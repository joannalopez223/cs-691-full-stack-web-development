# CS-691-Full-Stack-Web-Development
This course is an introduction to full stack web development. We will be using the Phoenix framework, a relatively new framework designed for high availability and reliability based on the Elixir language, a functional language that runs on the BEAM (Erlang) virtual machine. This gives it the ability to run thousands of concurrent processes and take advantage of all available cores on a machine.
